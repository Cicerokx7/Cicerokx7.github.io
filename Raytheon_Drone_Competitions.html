        <!-- <h1>Competing at the Forefront of Autonomous Technology</h1>
        <p>I am thrilled to be a part of a dynamic team working on an ambitious school final project in
             collaboration with Raytheon, an industry leader in technology and innovation. Our project is developing an autonomous drone and land vehicle to compete in a
               competition next summer. The goal is to demonstrate the cutting-edge capabilities
                of our technology by navigating the drone through challenging scenarios and utilizing computer
                 vision to locate and disable enemy ground vehicles with precision. This project represents
                  a remarkable fusion of engineering and computer science innovation.</p>
        <h1>Drones, Ground Vehicles, and Software</h1>
        <p>Our multidisciplinary team comprises both Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer
             Engineering (ECE) students. As part of the Computer Science (CS) team, my role is
              in preparing and programming the drone for this competition. I've already completed the crucial
               task of flashing the drone's computer and preparing the computer for the programs that will power its
                autonomous capabilities. We've thoroughly reviewed the software inherited from
                 previous teams, and we're currently harnessing ArduPilot's Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)
                  environment to rigorously test the drone's performance in a simulator.</p>
        <h1>Pioneering Computer Vision for Aerial Attacks</h1>
        <p>My upcoming responsibilities on this project include development of computer
             vision features for the drone. This technology will empower the drone to identify enemy ground
              vehicles and engage them. When a target is detected, our drone will employ
               water-based weaponry to disable the vehicle, ensuring mission success. The integration of computer
                vision into our drone's repertoire represents an exciting intersection of artificial intelligence,
                 robotics, and autonomous systems.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>I'm excited to be part of a collaborative team working on an autonomous drone and ground vehicle
            project in partnership with Raytheon. Our goal is to compete in a challenging competition next summer.
             I'm focused on integrating computer vision technology for targeting and disabling
              enemy ground vehicles. This project embodies innovation and teamwork across various engineering disciplines,
               and I'm eager to share our progress as we push the boundaries of autonomous technology.</p>-->

            <h1>Drones, Ground Vehicles, and Software</h1>
            <p>As a pivotal member of our multidisciplinary team, I helped to bridge
             the gap between Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer
             Engineering (ECE) domains. Drawing from my prior involvement in robotics,
             I seamlessly collaborate with both teams to implement software tailored
             for mechanical applications. In my role within the CS team, I've completed
             essential tasks such as flashing the drone's computer and preparing it for
             autonomous programming. My experience with robotics has afforded me a unique perspective, and understanding the software needed the ECE team.</p>
