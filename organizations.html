                <p>Since 2013, I have been honored to be an active member of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group
                 (DPRG), a distinguished robotics organization that has played a pivotal role in shaping my
                 journey in robotics and programming. The collaborative and supportive environment fostered by
                 DPRG has been instrumental in my educational and professional development. The organization's
                 members, a group of passionate and knowledgeable individuals, have generously shared their
                 expertise, providing valuable insights and guidance.</p>
                
                <p>Being a part of DPRG has not only expanded my technical skills but has also allowed me to
                 forge meaningful connections with like-minded individuals. The friendships cultivated within
                 this community have grown into strong bonds, and the members have become not only friends but
                 also mentors who have consistently offered their support and encouragement. The DPRG community
                 exemplifies the spirit of camaraderie and the power of collective knowledge, making it a
                 cornerstone of my personal and professional growth in the fields of robotics and programming.
                 I am grateful for the wealth of experiences, knowledge, and relationships that DPRG has provided,
                 and I look forward to continued collaboration and learning within this vibrant community.</p>

                <p>As a proud member of Phi Theta Kappa (PTK), the international honor society, I am dedicated to academic excellence and community service. PTK has provided me with opportunities for leadership, scholarship, and service.

                </div>
                <p>Over the course of a decade, my involvement in hockey has left an indelible mark on my
                 character, shaping my ability to work seamlessly within a team and instilling in me a strong work
                 ethic. As a dedicated player, I learned the intricate dynamics of teamwork, where communication,
                 cooperation, and trust are paramount. Navigating the fast-paced and physically demanding
                 environment of hockey has honed my resilience and determination, fostering a work ethic that
                 thrives on hard work, discipline, and perseverance. The pinnacle of my hockey journey was being
                 honored with the "Model Hockey Player Award" in my final year, a recognition that not only
                 symbolizes my individual dedication but also underscores the importance of embodying the values
                 of teamwork and commitment. The skills cultivated on the hockey rink, from effective communication
                 to relentless work ethic, are invaluable assets that I carry into every aspect of my life, both
                 professionally and personally.</p>
