        <h1>Creating an Exciting Game in Computer Graphics Class</h1>
        <p>I'm excited to share my involvement in a fun team project for my Computer Graphics class.
            Together with my talented teammates, we're crafting an engaging 3D game that challenges players to
            stack falling ingredients on a slider bun, all while aiming to match the menu items.
            Our game, built in Unity, has reached a stage where several core components have been
            established.</p>
        <h1>Key Achievements</h1>
        <p>As part of this collaborative effort, I've worked on many important aspects of the game's development.
            I've successfully implemented the bun's sliding mechanics, allowing players to navigate it around the
            screen. Additionally, I've created a dynamic system that spawns ingredients from the sky
            at random locations in front of the player, ensuring an unpredictable and exciting gameplay experience.
            These ingredients are intelligently designed to stack atop the bun, providing an immersive challenge for players.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In developing this 3D game, my internship experience with Space x View has played a pivotal role,
            allowing me to leverage my Unity and C# skills. This project exemplifies the seamless blend of my
             academic and professional experiences, contributing to my growth as a programmer and experience in computer graphics.
             Exciting progress lies ahead in this rewarding journey. I'm proud to have been a part of a team that is dedicated to creating a fun 3D game that blends
             creativity, technical skills, and lessons learned from class.</p>
