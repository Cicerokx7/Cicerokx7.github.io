        <h1>My Educational Journey</h1>
        <p>I'm on the cusp of graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science this December, marking
            the culmination my academic journey. My pursuit of knowledge began at Collin College, where I
            dedicated two and a half years to building a strong foundation in computer science. During my time
            there, I maintained an exceptional GPA of 3.8, a testament to my commitment to excellence in my studies.</p>
        <h1>Transcending Boundaries</h1>
        <p>The journey took an exciting turn when I transferred to the prestigious University of Texas at Dallas
            (UTD), further expanding my horizons in the realm of computer science. My current GPA at UTD stands
            at 3.674, reflecting my unwavering dedication to academic rigor. Throughout this phase of my education,
            I've not only excelled in the classroom but also actively participated in a range of hands-on experiences.</p>
        <h1>Internships, Projects, and Extracurriculars</h1>
        <p>One of the highlights of my academic journey was an enriching <a href="Space_x_View.html">internship</a> experience, where I was able to apply
            my knowledge in a practical setting.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I worked on numerous school projects and extracurricular projects
            that allowed me to put theory into practice, honing my problem-solving and software development skills. Many of these projects are discussed in the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page.</p>
        <p>As a member of Phi Theta Kappa, I've been a part of a community that celebrates academic excellence
            and fosters leadership. These experiences have not only shaped me as a computer scientist but have
            also instilled in me a commitment to ongoing learning and growth.</p>
        <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
        <p>As I stand on the brink of graduation, I'm excited about the opportunities that await in the field of
            computer science. My journey has been marked by dedication, academic achievements, and a commitment
            to excellence, and I'm eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in my future endeavors.</p>
