        <h1>Internship</h1>
        <p>My internship as a Virtual Reality Developer at Space View was a transformative experience that introduced
         me to the dynamic world of Metaverse development. This journey began when I encountered Space View's
         Metaverse prototype at a conference, instantly sparking my fascination with their projects. Eager to
         explore this innovative field, I delved deeper into the company and decided to apply for an internship.
         After a series of interviews, including one with the CEO, Mr. Junichi, I was honored to become Space
         View's first American intern.</p>

        <h1>Working With The Company</h1>
        <p>As a Virtual Reality Developer, my role was centered on refining user avatars, enhancing buildings,
         and enriching virtual environments. Leveraging Unity and C# scripting, I worked to create a Metaverse that
         blended real-world authenticity with the boundless possibilities of the digital realm. Space View, which
         initially focused on satellite technology and data analysis, has diversified into blockchain technology
         and Metaverse development. Working within a compact, globally dispersed team, I embraced the Agile
         development method and effectively collaborated with colleagues from various time zones.</p>

         <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
         <p>Throughout the internship, I learned Unity and C# to tackle a diverse range of tasks. This included
         avatar creation, enabling object collision, implementing a mini-map, and simulating interactive doors
         and windows. Adhering to the Scrum methodology, I streamlined my work, ensuring clear communication
         with my manager. My remote work experience, despite the challenges of coordinating across international
         time zones, underscored the benefits of a distraction-free home office. The clear objectives, regular
         meetings, and the sense of accomplishment enriched my work experience.</p>

         <h1>Summary</h1>
         <p>This internship not only broadened my technical expertise but also showcased the practical application
         of classroom learning in a real-world setting. It emphasized the significance of object-oriented programming,
         elevating my programming capabilities. As a result, I am now better prepared to contribute effectively to
         future endeavors, drawing on the knowledge and experience gained from my collaboration with Space View,
         a pioneer in the Metaverse development field. This internship served as a stepping stone in my career,
         providing a strong foundation for my future endeavors in the dynamic world of virtual reality and Metaverse
         development.</p>
