        <h1>The Hardware</h1>
        <p>During my high school years, I undertook a challenging and innovative project by designing and
         developing an autonomous robot with the capability to navigate sidewalks reliably. The robot, built
         on a small wagon base, featured rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steering. One of the key
         functionalities of the robot was its autonomous navigation system, which relied on computer vision
         through a strategically positioned camera on the right side of the robot.</p>
        <h1>The Sensors</h1>
        <p>The vision system was designed to recognize the color of the sidewalk and based on the color a
         bounding box is produced, allowing the robot to autonomously adjust its position. If the camera detected
         that the sidewalk was too large, indicating a deviation to the left, the robot autonomously corrected
         its course by turning to the right, and vice versa. To ensure obstacle avoidance, the robot was equipped
         with an ultrasonic sensor and a bumper, promptly stopping if any obstruction was detected in its path.</p>
        <h1>Additional Sensors</h1>
        <p>In addition to its autonomous capabilities, the robot featured a button
         positioned at the top allowed for a temporary halt, enabling users to pause the robot conveniently for
         tasks such as grabbing a drink from the cooler it carried. The incorporation of an encoder further
         enhanced the robot's performance, regulating its speed and ensuring smooth and controlled movement.</p>
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>The successful testing of the robot in my neighborhood, where it covered roughly two miles autonomously
         with a fully loaded cooler, demonstrated not only reliability of the  robotic but also the
         practical applicability of the project. This experience underscores my passion for problem-solving through
         technology and my ability to bring creative and functional solutions to real-world challenges.</p>
