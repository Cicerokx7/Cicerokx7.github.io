        <h1>TodoQ</h1>
        <p>Creating TodoQ, a Flutter and Dart-based application, was not just a project
         to learn the technologies but also a testament to my passion for practical
         problem-solving through software development. TodoQ introduces a unique twist
         to the conventional to-do list concept by implementing a FIFO (First In, First
         Out) queue system. This approach ensures that tasks are managed in the order
         they are added, with the topmost task highlighted as the next item to complete,
         promoting efficient task prioritization.</p>

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <p>The app offers a seamless user experience with intuitive features such as the
         ability to add, complete, edit, drag-and-drop, and delete tasks effortlessly.
         Additionally, TodoQ supports multiple queues, The queue management drawer enables
         users to easily switch between queues, rearrange, edit, and delete, enhancing
         productivity and organization.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>By developing TodoQ, I not only developed my skills in Flutter and Dart but
         also demonstrated my ability to conceptualize and implement innovative solutions
         to address everyday challenges. This project reflects my commitment to delivering
         user-centric applications that prioritize functionality, usability, and intuitive
         design. As I continue to grow as a software developer, I look forward to leveraging
         my experiences with projects like TodoQ to contribute meaningfully to future endeavors.</p>

         <h1>Download on Android</h1>
